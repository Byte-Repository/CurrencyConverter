# Currency-Converter-


I am not the creator of this project, I wanted to learn how to work with API's and how to create a currency calculator for one of my projects.

In simple terms, the Currency Converter allows an user to see how their own currencies compare to foreign currencies. I only used 3 currencies, although more can be added.
